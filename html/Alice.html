        <p> American Mcgee's Alice is a third person action adventure game, traversing through this twisted version of the Alice
            in Wonderland story that we all know and <span style="color: brown">love</span>.
             This game was originally made for PC and Mac OS in 2000, and with very little access 
            to playing this game anymore, sadly. This game got remastered once in 2011, 
            and the only current way <span style="color: brown">legally</span> to access this remaster if you bought
            the physical version of the sequel, Alice Madness Returns for 
            the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3. This game has become "<span style="color: brown">abandonware</span>", in which
            a game that is left in the dust and to be <span style="color: brown">forgotten</span>.

        mental health issues. She loses her family in a fire, and post-tragedy deals with survivor guilt and <span style="color: brown">PTSD</span>.
        She later gets sent to a mental health asylum for dementia, insanity and catatonia. Within Alice's Wonderland, 
        different parts of her real life is reflected into this dark twisted <span style="color: brown">reality</span>.

        <p> American Mcgee has tried to revive <br> 
             this franchise with a kickstarter in 2023,<br> 
             seeing much <span style="color: brown">support</span> from the fan base. <br>
             Mcgee created a design bible and even <br>
             pitched the idea to EA, but was <span style="color: brown">declined</span> <br>
             any funding for the project or any sort <br>
             of deal to buy the rights due to the <br>
             <span style="color: brown">importance</span> of Alice to the EA portfolio. <br>
             Is it really of any importance if they <br>
             don't even have any way to <span style="color: brown">buy or play</span> <br> 
             the game without going onto the second-hand <br>
             market or <span style="color: brown">emulation</span>? This is a company that <br>
             is infamous for showing how they truly care <br>
             about video games, its something for <span style="color: brown">profit</span>. <br>
             This game, and so many others, are an art piece <br>
             that deserve the <span style="color: brown">accessibility</span> to play, but <br>
             when given the chance, they don't <span style="color: brown">care</span>.
